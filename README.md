# Code 201 Final Project, Prep #1 : Team Agreement
This is normally a group assignment. However, working on it solo, my answers to the following questions will be mostly from that perspective. 


## Cooperation Plan
#### 1) What are the key strengths of each person on the team? 
My key strengths are organization and willingness to put in the work! 
#### 2) How can you best utilize these strengths in the execution of your project?
I will use my strengths by first organizing a list of all components of the project to complete. Then, I will break down each component into smaller parts to execute one by one! 
#### 3) In which professional competencies do you each want to develop greater strength?
I would like to develop my tech skills with this project. 
#### 4) Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand all aspects of the project, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day work?
Luckily, I am working on my own in this case. It means I will have more work to complete, but I also have control over all aspects and can plan accordingly. 

## Conflict Plan 
#### 1) What will be your group’s process to resolve conflict, when it arises?
I will probably need to take breaks and reach out to TA's for help as needed. 
#### 2) What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other members contribute?
No worries on this one! But for future team projects, I would hope to establish solid communication beforehand on how we will share contributions. 
#### 3) How will you approach each other and the challenges of the project knowing that it is impossible for all members to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?
This can be tough when working in a group. I think it is important to set  out expectations from the begining and have everyone commit to a certain timeline and how to handle communication if something pops up and we need to pivot. 
#### 4) How will you raise concerns to members who are not adequately contributing?
I have run into this issue in the past on team projects! I am not afraid to speak up and let someone know they are not meeting expectations. 
#### 5) How and when will you escalate the conflict if your resolution attempts are unsuccessful?
I would say if 2-3 attempts go unanswered, I would get the instructor involved for further assistance. 

## Communication Plan
#### 1) What hours will you be available to communicate?
I plan to work mostly during evenings and weekends, but off and on throughout the day. 
#### 2) What platforms will you use to communicate (ie. Slack, phone …)?
Just my note taking should keep me on track 
#### 3) How often will you take breaks?
As often as I need! 
#### 4) What is your plan if you start to fall behind?
Push through! Only 2 weeks of class left from today! 
#### 5) How will you communicate after hours and on the weekend?
Not needed as a solo project.
#### 6) What is your strategy for ensuring everyone’s voice is heard?
Not a concern as a solo project. But as a group, this is extremely important. I would make sure everyone has a fair contribution to the project and the option to speak up with new ideas or concerns throughout the project. 
#### 7) How will you ensure that you are creating a safe environment where everyone feels comfortable speaking up?
I like the idea of using the timeout card and breaks when conflicts arise. I also like the idea of setting up the ground rules of communication and expectations from the begining. 

## Work Plan 
#### 1) How you will identify tasks, assign tasks, know when they are complete, and manage work in general?
Being the only one working on the project means I will have a lot of tasks to complete. I will have to stay focused on the big picture while making sure the details are in line as well. 
#### 2) What project management tool will be used?
I will not be using any additional tools. Most likely some notes and lists of my own to keep me on track should suffice. 

## Git Process
#### 1) What components of your project will live on GitHub?
The entire project will be on Git. 
#### 2) How will you share the repository with your teammates?
Luckily, I won't have to share! 
#### 3) What is your Git flow?
I will mainly work on the project in my terminal until it is time to ACP to Git. 
#### 4) Will you be using a PR review workflow? If so, consider:
I do not believe so. 
#### 5) How many people must review a PR?
Just me! 
#### 6) Who merges PRs?
I will 
#### 7) How often will you merge?
As needed
#### 8) How will you communicate that it’s time to merge? 
Working alone, this will be as I am ready to merge.
